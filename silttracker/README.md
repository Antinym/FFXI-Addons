This is a very simple tool I wrote for myself to easily track the earning of beads during intense farming sessions.

The display is updated after the player loses either the Confrontation or Elvorseal buffs, for NMs in Escha/Reisenjima or Domain Invasion.  
It is also updated anytime the character changes zone - this can be disabled by setting `update_on_zone` to false (surprising, huh).

It can be repositioned but currently it does not save settings, edit the file directly for that.

Enjoy.
