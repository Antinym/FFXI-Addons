# Lili's Addons
A collection of addons I wrote for Final Fantasy XI, compatible with the [Windower launcher](http://windower.net/).  

Complete addons:
- Smeagol: automatically use CP/XP rings (and gear).
- Dupefind: find identical items scattered across different inventory bags.
- Friendzone
- Indi-Nope: removes graphical effect from Indi-Spells.
- Witness Protection: assigns random persistent names to characters and linkshells that appear on screen (anonymize your screen)
- Silt Tracker: track earnings of Silt and Beads in Escha/Reisenjima.  

Utilities:
- posfind: click to find your ingame coordinates (X,Y,Z)
- clickfind: click to find the screen coordinates (useful for placing addon text boxes)
